# Notices for ehcp.bin, the ESP32-C6 firmware

`ehcp.bin` is Espressif's **ESP-Hosted** co-processor firmware for the Fruit
Jam's ESP32-C6, built for this board's wiring. None of it is UbiqOS code. It is
published beside UbiqOS releases so that a Fruit Jam can be given WiFi without
installing ESP-IDF; this file is what must travel with it.

## What it is built from

- ESP-Hosted MCU, <https://github.com/espressif/esp-hosted-mcu>, commit
  `3450367b247f1881153ca3ea6703e1d82cfb2405` (3.0.7), the example
  `examples/wifi/sta/cp`, unmodified;
- ESP-IDF v5.5.5, <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf>, unmodified;
- this board's settings, [`sdkconfig.defaults.fruitjam`](sdkconfig.defaults.fruitjam),
  built by [`build.sh`](build.sh) and merged into one image with `esptool
  merge_bin` as [docs/fruit-jam.md](../../docs/fruit-jam.md) shows. That is
  also how to build it again from source.

## What is in it, and under what licence

| Component | Licence |
|---|---|
| ESP-Hosted (Espressif) | Apache-2.0 |
| ESP-IDF, and Espressif's WiFi and PHY libraries (Espressif) | Apache-2.0 |
| Mbed TLS (in ESP-IDF) | Apache-2.0 |
| FreeRTOS kernel (in ESP-IDF) | MIT |
| lwIP (in ESP-IDF) | BSD-3-Clause |
| wpa_supplicant (in ESP-IDF) | BSD-3-Clause |
| newlib (in ESP-IDF) | BSD-style, several |
| protobuf-c (in ESP-Hosted) | BSD-2-Clause |

The components were read from the source paths the image itself carries. The
list ESP-IDF keeps of everything it includes, whether this image uses it or
not, is its `COPYRIGHT.rst`, reproduced at the end.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this

   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
   this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
   sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
   applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that
   are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
   combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
   Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
   against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
   lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
   the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
   any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
   shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
   Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications,
   and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following
   conditions:

   a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
      copy of this License; and

   b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that You changed the files; and

   c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
      distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices

      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

   d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within
      such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
      part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following
      places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
      Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if
      provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
      generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
      notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
      informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may
      add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
      distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
      Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
      construed as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
    provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
    reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
    Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
    distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
    in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
   Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to
   the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,

   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to
   in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides
   its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
   OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
   any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
   MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
   responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
   redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
   exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether
   in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required
   by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or
   agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
   damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
   consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
   License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
   not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
   failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
   losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of
   such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
   fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
   obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
   accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
   Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
   only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
   harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
   Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
   liability.
